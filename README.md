# Data-Science-Case-Study

### Problem Statement
The dataset "Course Reviews and Ratings " contains reviews of different courses offered by a university. <br> In this project I will train a classifier which helps to predict the ‘course_rating’ column, which indicates whether the course was liked or disliked by the reviewer.
 
###### Aim of the Project is : <br>
- Finding interesting insights and patterns
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data
- Feature engineering to help train your classifier
- Training an efficient and scalable model (Try to use different ML algorithms and think about what works best in this case)
- Splitting the dataset into 80%/20% for train/test sets, in order to evaluate the performance of your classifier (Think about the best way to split for an accurate representation of your performance)
- Deciding upon the optimal performance metrics to for this case
